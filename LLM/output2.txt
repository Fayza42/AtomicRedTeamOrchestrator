No predefined objectives - purely autonomous

 MISSION X: Enhanced Autonomous Red Team Analysis with Executable Scripts

 TARGET ANALYSIS:

 * Web application vulnerability testing
 * Multi-platform attack scenarios
 * Practical penetration testing commands
 * Script-based automation

 VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:

 * Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the 7 VPLE applications
 * Analysis of potential vulnerabilities based on technology stack

 TECHNIQUES SELECTED:

 * CAPEC-XXX: [Attack pattern reasoning]
 * TXXXX: [MITRE technique reasoning]
 * Atomic Test: [Executable script reference if available]

 EXECUTABLE ATTACK SCRIPTS:

 Linux/Bash Commands:

1. Identify vulnerable applications and versions using `uname -a` and `lsb_release -a`.
2. Gather system information with `uname -a`, `lsb_release -a`, and `cat /etc/os-release`.
3. Check for known vulnerabilities in web applications using `curl -s http://example.com | sed -n '4p'`.
4. Test for susceptibility to command injection attacks with `echo "Hello World" | base64 -d 0L`.
5. Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities using `curl -X POST http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/http.php -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Connection: close" -d 'a=1'`.

 PowerShell Scripts:

1. Identify vulnerable applications and versions using `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product -Filter "name='Web Application Firewall'" | Select-Object Name, Version`.
2. Gather system information with `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product -Filter "name='Operating System'" | Select-Object Name, Version`.
3. Check for known vulnerabilities in web applications using `Invoke-Webrequest -Uri http://example.com | Select-Object -First 4`.
4. Test for susceptibility to command injection attacks with `Invoke-Webrequest -Uri http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/http.php -Method Post -Body "a=1" -ContentType ApplicationJson`.
5. Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities using `Invoke-Webrequest -Uri http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/http.php -Method Post -Body "a=1" -ContentType ApplicationJson`.

 Python Scripts:

1. Identify vulnerable applications and versions using `subprocess.check_output(['uname', '-a'])` and `subprocess.check_output(['lsb_release', '-a'])`.
2. Gather system information with `subprocess.check_output(['uname', '-a'])` and `subprocess.check_output(['lsb_release', '-a'])`.
3. Check for known vulnerabilities in web applications using `requests.get('http://example.com')` and ` BeautifulSoup((requests.get('http://example.com')).text]`.
4. Test for susceptibility to command injection attacks with `subprocess.check_output(['curl', '-s', 'http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/http.php'], stdout=True)`.
5. Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities using `subprocess.check_output(['curl', '-X', 'POST', 'http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/http.php'], stdout=True)`.

 SUCCESS VERIFICATION:

 * Verify successful exploitation with `echo "Exploited!" | curl -s http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/http.php`.

 CLEANUP COMMANDS:

 * Remove any temporary files or directories created during the mission.
