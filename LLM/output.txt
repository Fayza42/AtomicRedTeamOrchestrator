üéØ AUTONOMOUS AGENT RESPONSE:
==================================================
  Mission 1: Broken Access Control (CAPEC-655) on DVWA

Target Applications: DVWA (PHP/MySQL) on port 1335

CAPEC/MITRE Techniques: Avoid Security Tool Identification by Adding Data, Add Data to Change the Checksum of a File

Attack Methodology:

1. Identify vulnerable files and directories in DVWA.
2. Add malicious data to the vulnerable files and directories to increase their size beyond what security tools can handle.
3. Modify the checksum of the files and directories to avoid detection by security tools.

Success Criteria:

1. The attacker must successfully add malicious data to the vulnerable files and directories without triggering any security alerts or warnings.
2. The attacker must modify the checksum of the files and directories to avoid detection by security tools.

Mission 2: Relative Path Traversal (CAPEC-41) on Mutillidae

Target Applications: Mutillidae (PHP/MySQL) on port 1336

CAPEC/MITRE Techniques: Relative Path Traversal, Use of Unnecessary Directories

Attack Methodology:

1. Identify vulnerable directories and files in Mutillidae.
2. Use relative path traversal to access sensitive files and directories.
3. Create unnecessary directories to gain access to sensitive files and directories.

Success Criteria:

1. The attacker must successfully use relative path traversal to access sensitive files and directories without triggering any security alerts or warnings.
2. The attacker must create unnecessary directories to gain access to sensitive files and directories.

Mission 3: Command Injection (CAPEC-46) on WebGoat

Target Applications: WebGoat (Java) on port 1337

CAPEC/MITRE Techniques: Command Injection, Use of Unnecessary Encoding

Attack Methodology:

1. Identify vulnerable input points in WebGoat.
2. Craft a malicious request with command injection payloads.
3. Use unnecessary encoding to bypass input filtering and sanitization.

Success Criteria:

1. The attacker must successfully inject malicious commands into WebGoat without triggering any security alerts or warnings.
2. The attacker must use unnecessary encoding to bypass input filtering and sanitization.

Mission 4: File Inclusion (CAPEC-30) on bWAPP

Target Applications: bWAPP (PHP/MySQL) on port 8080

CAPEC/MITRE Techniques: File Inclusion, Use of Unnecessary Directories

Attack Methodology:

1. Identify vulnerable files and directories in bWAPP.
2. Use file inclusion to access sensitive files and directories.
3. Create unnecessary directories to gain access to sensitive files and directories.

Success Criteria:

1. The attacker must successfully use file inclusion to access sensitive files and directories without triggering any security alerts or warnings.
2. The attacker must create unnecessary directories to gain access to sensitive files and directories.

Mission 5: Persistence (CAPEC-649) on Security Ninjas

Target Applications: Security Ninjas (PHP) on port 8899

CAPEC/MITRE Techniques: Persistence, Add Data to Change the Checksum of a File

Attack Methodology:

1. Identify vulnerable files and directories in Security Ninjas.
2. Add malicious data to the vulnerable files and directories to increase their size beyond what security tools can handle.
3. Modify the checksum of the files and directories to avoid detection by security tools.

Success Criteria:

1. The attacker must successfully add malicious data to the vulnerable files and directories without triggering any security alerts or warnings.
2. The attacker must modify the checksum of the files and directories to avoid detection by security tools.

Mission 6: Unnecessary File Access (CAPEC-47) on WordPress

Target Applications: WordPress (PHP/MySQL) on port 8800

CAPEC/MITRE Techniques: Unnecessary File Access, Use of Unnecessary Directories

Attack Methodology:

1. Identify vulnerable files and directories in WordPress.
2. Use unnecessary file access to access sensitive files and directories.
3. Create unnecessary directories to gain access to sensitive files and directories.

Success Criteria:

1. The attacker must successfully use unnecessary file access to access sensitive files and directories without triggering any security alerts or warnings.
2. The attacker must create unnecessary directories to gain access to sensitive files and directories.

Each mission should be attempted independently, with the goal of achieving a successful exploitation of each vulnerability. The attacker should use their skills and knowledge of CAPEC/MITRE techniques to create comprehensive attack plans for each application type.
